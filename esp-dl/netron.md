## Netron Support

We have added support for `.espdl` models in netron (a visualizer for neural network).
Please install and launch it as follows:

```
# install netron with espdl support
pip install  git+https://github.com/sun-xiangyu/netron

# launch web browser
netron-dl
```

We plan to merge this modification into the official netron project.   
For specific status, please refer to the [PR](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron/pull/1519).
